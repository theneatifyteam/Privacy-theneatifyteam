                <h2>Privacy Policy – Neatify Staff App</h2>
                <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 6 February 2026</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Neatify Staff App (“App”) is operated by The Neatify Team (“Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). The
                    App is intended exclusively for authorized service staff to manage and complete assigned
                    work-related tasks.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect information when you use the
                    Neatify Staff App.</p>

                <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>We collect only the minimum information required to operate the App and support internal service
                    operations.</p>

                <p><strong>a. Personal Information</strong><br>
                    We collect basic personal information such as your name, registered phone number, and staff
                    identification details. This information is used to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create and manage staff accounts</li>
                    <li>Verify user identity</li>
                    <li>Assign service tasks accurately</li>
                    <li>Maintain operational accountability</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not collect unnecessary or excessive personal data.</p>

                <p><strong>b. Camera and Image Data</strong><br>
                    The App may access the device camera to allow users to capture service-related images, such as
                    before-and-after work photos. These images are used strictly for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Task documentation</li>
                    <li>Quality assurance</li>
                    <li>Operational verification</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Camera access is activated only when the user initiates an image capture action and is never used in
                    the background.</p>

                <p><strong>c. Storage Access</strong><br>
                    Storage access is required to temporarily store images captured or selected by the user before
                    uploading them to secure servers. The App:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does not scan, read, or access unrelated files or media</li>
                    <li>Accesses storage strictly for work-related images</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>d. OTP and Authentication Data</strong><br>
                    We collect phone numbers to send One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for secure login and authentication.
                    OTPs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are used only for verification purposes</li>
                    <li>Are time-bound</li>
                    <li>Are not stored permanently after verification</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This helps prevent unauthorized access.</p>

                <p><strong>e. Internet and Network Data</strong><br>
                    The App requires internet access to authenticate users, sync job details, upload images, and
                    communicate with backend services. Network access is used solely for functional operation.</p>
                <p>The App does not track, profile, or monitor users and does not collect precise location data.</p>

                <h3>2. Purpose of Data Collection</h3>
                <p>We collect and use data strictly for legitimate operational, security, and compliance purposes.</p>

                <p><strong>a. Authentication and Authorization</strong><br>
                    User information is used to verify staff identity and ensure only authorized personnel can access
                    the App and assigned tasks.</p>

                <p><strong>b. Task Assignment and Management</strong><br>
                    Collected information allows us to assign, manage, and track service tasks efficiently, ensuring
                    accountability and operational accuracy.</p>

                <p><strong>c. Service Documentation</strong><br>
                    Images and task updates are used to document service activities, verify job completion, ensure
                    service quality, and resolve operational issues if required.</p>

                <p><strong>d. Application Stability and Improvement</strong><br>
                    Technical and usage-related data may be used internally to monitor performance, identify errors, and
                    improve reliability and user experience.</p>

                <p><strong>e. Service Quality and Compliance</strong><br>
                    Information may be used for internal audits, quality checks, and compliance verification in
                    accordance with company standards and applicable regulations.</p>

                <p><strong>f. No Advertising or Marketing Use</strong><br>
                    We do not use user data for advertising, promotions, analytics for marketing, or third-party
                    marketing purposes.</p>

                <h3>3. OTP-Based Authentication</h3>
                <p>The App uses OTP-based authentication instead of passwords to enhance security and reduce the risk of
                    account misuse.</p>

                <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
                <p>All data transmitted between the App and our servers is protected using HTTPS encryption. Stored data
                    is safeguarded using authentication controls, role-based access, and industry-standard security
                    practices.</p>

                <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>The App may use trusted third-party services for backend infrastructure, hosting, authentication, and
                    performance monitoring necessary for app operation.</p>
                <p>These services are used strictly for operational purposes and are required to comply with applicable
                    data protection standards. No user data is shared for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>

                <h3>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
                <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade user data. Data may be shared only:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With authorized internal systems</li>
                    <li>With trusted service providers required to operate the App</li>
                    <li>When required by law, regulation, or legal process</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7. Data Retention</h3>
                <p>User data is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill operational, legal, or compliance
                    requirements. When no longer required, data is securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

                <h3>8. User Rights and Control</h3>
                <p>Users may request access, correction, or deletion of their personal data, subject to legal
                    obligations. Requests will be addressed within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

                <h3>9. Children’s Privacy</h3>
                <p>The App is intended for individuals 18 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect personal
                    information from children. If such data is identified, it will be deleted promptly.</p>

                <h3>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be published with a revised
                    date. Continued use of the App indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

                <h3>11. Grievance Officer & Contact Information</h3>
                <p>In accordance with applicable Indian laws, users may contact our designated Grievance Officer for any
                    concerns related to data privacy, app usage, or compliance.</p>
